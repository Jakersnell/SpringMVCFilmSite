# Description
This project is a great example of a website that interfaces with a database for its operations.
The website allows the user to search the website for various films by different methods such as the films id or keywords in the films title or description.  
I aimed to model the feel and function of IMDB or similar sites for this project, while it isnt as in depth as a website like IMDB
the premise is similar and it is a good rough model of the concept.  The website gives the user the opportunity to see a variety of films on the website
and to search for and view those films in one of two ways, a list-view or a detail-view. Spring-mvc was great for the tools it provides to construct an MVC pattern,
and the framework handles a large amount of the tedious elements for you, which I greatly appreciate as it allows me to focus my efforts on clean coding. JDBC was used for
the database connection and MySql was used for the database.
